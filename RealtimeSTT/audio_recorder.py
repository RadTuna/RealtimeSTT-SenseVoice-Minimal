"""

The AudioToTextRecorder class in the provided code facilitates
fast speech-to-text transcription.

The class employs the sense voice library to transcribe the recorded audio
into text using machine learning models, which can be run either on a GPU or
CPU. Voice activity detection (VAD) is built in, meaning the software can
automatically start or stop recording based on the presence or absence of
speech. It integrates wake word detection through the pvporcupine library,
allowing the software to initiate recording when a specific word or phrase
is spoken. The system provides real-time feedback and can be further
customized.

Features:
- Voice Activity Detection: Automatically starts/stops recording when speech
  is detected or when speech ends.
- Wake Word Detection: Starts recording when a specified wake word (or words)
  is detected.
- Event Callbacks: Customizable callbacks for when recording starts
  or finishes.
- Fast Transcription: Returns the transcribed text from the audio as fast
  as possible.

        Initializes an audio recorder and  transcription
        and wake word detection.

        Args:
        - model_path (str): Path to the SenseVoice model directory.
            The model should be a pre-downloaded SenseVoice model
            in ONNX format. The model will be loaded from this path
            for transcription.
        - language (str, default="auto"): Language code for speech-to-text engine.
            If not specified, the model will attempt to detect the language
            automatically.
        - input_device_index (int, default=0): The index of the audio input
            device to use.
        - on_recording_start (callable, default=None): Callback function to be
            called when recording of audio to be transcripted starts.
        - on_recording_stop (callable, default=None): Callback function to be
            called when recording of audio to be transcripted stops.
        - on_transcription_start (callable, default=None): Callback function
            to be called when transcription of audio to text starts.
        - ensure_sentence_starting_uppercase (bool, default=True): Ensures
            that every sentence detected by the algorithm starts with an
            uppercase letter.
        - ensure_sentence_ends_with_period (bool, default=True): Ensures that
            every sentence that doesn't end with punctuation such as "?", "!"
            ends with a period
        - use_microphone (bool, default=True): Specifies whether to use the
            microphone as the audio input source. If set to False, the
            audio input source will be the audio data sent through the
            feed_audio() method.
        - spinner (bool, default=True): Show spinner animation with current
            state.
        - level (int, default=logging.WARNING): Logging level.
        - silero_sensitivity (float, default=SILERO_SENSITIVITY): Sensitivity
            for the Silero Voice Activity Detection model ranging from 0
            (least sensitive) to 1 (most sensitive). Default is 0.5.
        - silero_use_onnx (bool, default=False): Enables usage of the
            pre-trained model from Silero in the ONNX (Open Neural Network
            Exchange) format instead of the PyTorch format. This is
            recommended for faster performance.
        - silero_deactivity_detection (bool, default=False): Enables the Silero
            model for end-of-speech detection. More robust against background
            noise. Utilizes additional GPU resources but improves accuracy in
            noisy environments. When False, uses the default WebRTC VAD,
            which is more sensitive but may continue recording longer due
            to background sounds.
        - webrtc_sensitivity (int, default=WEBRTC_SENSITIVITY): Sensitivity
            for the WebRTC Voice Activity Detection engine ranging from 0
            (least aggressive / most sensitive) to 3 (most aggressive,
            least sensitive). Default is 3.
        - post_speech_silence_duration (float, default=0.2): Duration in
            seconds of silence that must follow speech before the recording
            is considered to be completed. This ensures that any brief
            pauses during speech don't prematurely end the recording.
        - min_gap_between_recordings (float, default=1.0): Specifies the
            minimum time interval in seconds that should exist between the
            end of one recording session and the beginning of another to
            prevent rapid consecutive recordings.
        - min_length_of_recording (float, default=1.0): Specifies the minimum
            duration in seconds that a recording session should last to ensure
            meaningful audio capture, preventing excessively short or
            fragmented recordings.
        - pre_recording_buffer_duration (float, default=0.2): Duration in
            seconds for the audio buffer to maintain pre-roll audio
            (compensates speech activity detection latency)
        - on_vad_detect_start (callable, default=None): Callback function to
            be called when the system listens for voice activity.
        - on_vad_detect_stop (callable, default=None): Callback function to be
            called when the system stops listening for voice activity.
        - wakeword_backend (str, default="pvporcupine"): Specifies the backend
            library to use for wake word detection. Supported options include
            'pvporcupine' for using the Porcupine wake word engine or 'oww' for
            using the OpenWakeWord engine.
        - openwakeword_model_paths (str, default=None): Comma-separated paths
            to model files for the openwakeword library. These paths point to
            custom models that can be used for wake word detection when the
            openwakeword library is selected as the wakeword_backend.
        - openwakeword_inference_framework (str, default="onnx"): Specifies
            the inference framework to use with the openwakeword library.
            Can be either 'onnx' for Open Neural Network Exchange format 
            or 'tflite' for TensorFlow Lite.
        - wake_words (str, default=""): Comma-separated string of wake words to
            initiate recording when using the 'pvporcupine' wakeword backend.
            Supported wake words include: 'alexa', 'americano', 'blueberry',
            'bumblebee', 'computer', 'grapefruits', 'grasshopper', 'hey google',
            'hey siri', 'jarvis', 'ok google', 'picovoice', 'porcupine',
            'terminator'. For the 'openwakeword' backend, wake words are
            automatically extracted from the provided model files, so specifying
            them here is not necessary.
        - wake_words_sensitivity (float, default=0.5): Sensitivity for wake
            word detection, ranging from 0 (least sensitive) to 1 (most
            sensitive). Default is 0.5.
        - wake_word_activation_delay (float, default=0): Duration in seconds
            after the start of monitoring before the system switches to wake
            word activation if no voice is initially detected. If set to
            zero, the system uses wake word activation immediately.
        - wake_word_timeout (float, default=5): Duration in seconds after a
            wake word is recognized. If no subsequent voice activity is
            detected within this window, the system transitions back to an
            inactive state, awaiting the next wake word or voice activation.
        - wake_word_buffer_duration (float, default=0.1): Duration in seconds
            to buffer audio data during wake word detection. This helps in
            cutting out the wake word from the recording buffer so it does not
            falsely get detected along with the following spoken text, ensuring
            cleaner and more accurate transcription start triggers.
            Increase this if parts of the wake word get detected as text.
        - on_wakeword_detected (callable, default=None): Callback function to
            be called when a wake word is detected.
        - on_wakeword_timeout (callable, default=None): Callback function to
            be called when the system goes back to an inactive state after when
            no speech was detected after wake word activation
        - on_wakeword_detection_start (callable, default=None): Callback
             function to be called when the system starts to listen for wake
             words
        - on_wakeword_detection_end (callable, default=None): Callback
            function to be called when the system stops to listen for
            wake words (e.g. because of timeout or wake word detected)
        - on_recorded_chunk (callable, default=None): Callback function to be
            called when a chunk of audio is recorded. The function is called
            with the recorded audio chunk as its argument.
        - handle_buffer_overflow (bool, default=True): If set to True, the system
            will log a warning when an input overflow occurs during recording and
            remove the data from the buffer.
        - buffer_size (int, default=512): The buffer size to use for audio
            recording. Changing this may break functionality.
        - sample_rate (int, default=16000): The sample rate to use for audio
            recording. Changing this will very probably functionality (as the
            WebRTC VAD model is very sensitive towards the sample rate).
        - suppress_tokens (list of int, default=[-1]): Tokens to be suppressed
            from the transcription output.
        - print_transcription_time (bool, default=False): Logs processing time
            of main model transcription 
        - early_transcription_on_silence (int, default=0): If set, the
            system will transcribe audio faster when silence is detected.
            Transcription will start after the specified milliseconds, so 
            keep this value lower than post_speech_silence_duration. 
            Ideally around post_speech_silence_duration minus the estimated
            transcription time with the main model.
            If silence lasts longer than post_speech_silence_duration, the 
            recording is stopped, and the transcription is submitted. If 
            voice activity resumes within this period, the transcription 
            is discarded. Results in faster final transcriptions to the cost
            of additional GPU load due to some unnecessary final transcriptions.
        - allowed_latency_limit (int, default=100): Maximal amount of chunks
            that can be unprocessed in queue before discarding chunks.
        - no_log_file (bool, default=False): Skips writing of debug log file.

        Raises:
            Exception: Errors related to initializing transcription
